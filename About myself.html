 <div id="x01">Hello there! Myself Taha Ujjainwala, a keen learner with an innovative mind, who loves to create new things. I am a student of <u>Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah, Arabic academy</u>.
Parallel with studies, I have developed many soft skills which will benefit me in the future. Graphic Designing is my favourite subject and I love to illustrate my thoughts in visual form by creating:
      <ol type="i">
         <li>Illustrations</li> 
         <li>Designs</li>
         <li>Manipulations</li>
      </ol>
    This year, I am focusing on <em>Web Development</em> under the guidance of <strong>The Deparment of Arts</strong>. This is the first webpage which I have created after learning some basics.
 Please have a look.
<br>Thank you.
