 <div id="x01">Hello there! Myself Taha Ujjainwala, a keen learner with an innovative mind, who loves to create new things. I am a student of Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah, Arabic academy.
Parallel with studies, the academy provides us the platform to learn and specialize in whatever field we want. Till now, I have learned many designing software of Adobe. I love to 
illustrate my thoughts in visual form by creating:
      <ol type="i">
         <li>Illustrations</li> 
         <li>Designs</li>
         <li>Manipulations</li>
      </ol>
    In this academic year, I am focusing on <em>Web Development</em> under the guidance of the Deparment of Arts. This is the first webpage that I have created after learning some basics.
 Please have a look.
<br>Thank you!
